# metadataEnmapa

Small App that extract coordinates from photo's metadata and then represent those coordinates in google maps.  Also creates a TXT file with the files names and the coordinates.

Peque√±a aplicacion que obtiene las coordenadas desde la metadata de las fotos y las plasma en un mapa de google maps Tambien crea un archivo TXT con los nombres de los archivos y las coordenadas en ellos.

C#

This project started like some sort of challange, a friend of mine who is an expert in Autocad, Civil Design and 3DMax needed to extract the coordenates hidden in the metadata of some photos taken with a drone.  I told him it can be done with C# without really know if it could be done.

This was my first noneducational project done with C#.

For this i used two libraries i found in internet and i recomend, one ExifLib that has the code that extract the metadata from the photos. The other library was GMap.NET, this library allow me to represent the aforementioned coordinates in a map of Google Maps, it in theory works with other providers too.

This program take all the jpg files in a folder the user choose, search among them those with metadata/coordinates, show those files names and their corresponding coordinates in a multiline richtextbox and save then in a TXT file that you define in the UI, also shows the representation of those points in the map.

Since i'm not an expert in C# (as you probably will notice due to the slopiness of the code) we can conclude that those libraries are relativelly easy to use.

Hope someone find this code usefull.
